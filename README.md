# Deliveroo Project

## Project Overview

**Deliveroo** is a courier service application designed to streamline parcel delivery by allowing users to send parcels to various destinations efficiently. With features for creating delivery orders, modifying them, and viewing delivery details, Deliveroo provides users with an intuitive interface for managing their parcels. Additionally, the service offers real-time updates and visualization through Google Maps integration, ensuring users are always informed about their deliveries.

## MVP Features

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Deliveroo includes the following features:

1. **User Account Management:**
   - Users can create an account and log in.

2. **Parcel Delivery Order Management:**
   - Users can create a parcel delivery order.
   - Users can change the destination of a parcel delivery order.
   - Users can cancel a parcel delivery order.
   - Users can view the details of a delivery order.

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Admins can change the status of a parcel delivery order.
   - Admins can update the present location of a parcel delivery order.

4. **Google Maps Integration:**
   - The application displays a Google Map with markers indicating the pickup location and the destination.
   - The application shows a line connecting both markers (pickup location and destination).
   - The application computes and displays the travel distance and journey duration between the pickup location and the destination.

## Optional Features

- **Real-Time Notifications:**
  - Users receive real-time email notifications when the Admin changes the status of their parcel.
  - Users receive real-time email notifications when the Admin updates the present location of their parcel.

> **Note:**
>
> - Users can only cancel or change the destination of a parcel delivery order if the parcelâ€™s status has not been marked as delivered.
> - Only the user who created the parcel delivery order can cancel the order.

## Technical Expectations

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Wireframes:** Figma (Mobile Friendly)

   cd deliveroo
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   - Navigate to the backend directory:

     ```bash
     cd Deliveroo_backend
     ```

   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:

     ```bash  
     virtual venv env
     source venv/bin/activate  
     ```

   - Install backend dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the database connection settings in the `config.py` file.

   - Run the Flask development server:

     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
